## Description
I started my IT journey by learning html and CSS. I made this simple website as my homework.

At the time of writing this readme, I am looking for a job as a QA engineer. Therefore, this site is not only my homework but also a tool for finding a job.

This is a simple, minimalistic landing page that includes several blocks: resume, interests, skills, and contact information.

I made the layout of the site relatively quickly, but for a very long time I could not figure out how to make it responsive for mobile devices.

## Roadmap
I really enjoyed the process of writing the site. Perhaps in the future I will add a night theme, a feedback form and a portfolio block.
